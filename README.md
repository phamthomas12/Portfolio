Week 2 Homework

This week we were asked to create a Porfolio webpage as part of finishing the HTML and CSS module of the course, my understanding of the task was to create something that I would want to slowly improve on over time so I made everything with the intention of fixing
minor issues i had and slowly develop the website into something i will have on my Resume. I did understand that I was ment to make it as similar to the images that was provided but it was a little too late for me to do so, so i decided to continue

Over the course of this Homework, I was going in and out of frustation towards the work however I knew that at the end of the day the reward will outway the struggles towards it, in the end i dont think I used any Bootsrap elements in my Homework even though i 
started out with trying to use it where I can. I did instead find it hard to overwrite the styling of the Boostrap

Overall I am just content with what I have, and i know with more time I would have been able to touch the media queries more

I noticed that my navbar on the portfolio page is smaller than the index.html and contact.html

I was not able to add the images as part of the README.md file, however they are located in the assets\Screenshots folder of the repository
