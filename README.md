# Thomas Pham Portfolio
Restrucutred my Portfolio, I feel there is a lot more I can do however I had a very busy week so was not able to fully remake my portfolio to look more presentable. I do plan to remake it so it can showcase a lot more of my skills that I have learnt from this course. I still plan to work on this slowly as the course progresses and I can use a lot more back-end coding

This is the default page that appears when the user first opens the webpage:

This is the porfolio page that has the Homework that I am proud to have made:

This is the Contact Page to contact me for now pressing the button doesnt send me anything for now:

Issues:
<ul>
<li>Cant centre the container for both the portfolio and contact page for now</li>
<li>Cant get the collapsed nav dropdown to toggle</li>
</ul>
