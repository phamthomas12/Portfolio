# Thomas Pham Portfolio
Restrucutred my Portfolio, I feel there is a lot more I can do however I had a very busy week so was not able to fully remake my portfolio to look more presentable. I do plan to remake it so it can showcase a lot more of my skills that I have learnt from this course. I still plan to work on this slowly as the course progresses and I can use a lot more back-end coding
